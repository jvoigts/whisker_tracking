# whisker_tracking
Unsupervised whisker tracking in freely behaving mice/rats

This repository includes a copy of ConvNet by Sergey Demyanov ( https://github.com/sdemyanov/ConvNet ) - if you'd rather use a recent version please get the current code from github.

This is _not_ the code described in our paper 'Unsupervised whisker tracking in unrestrained behaving animals', J Voigts, B Sakmann, T Celikel, Journal of neurophysiology 100 (1), 504-515 ( http://jn.physiology.org/content/100/1/504.short ), but a more recent, and simplified method.

There are two main analysis steps in this implementation: Identifying animal presence and nose tracking, and whisker tracking.
